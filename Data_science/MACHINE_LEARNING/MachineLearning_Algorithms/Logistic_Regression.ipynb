    "Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class. It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False or 0/1. It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1."

    "\n",
    "- `Multinomial Logistic Regression`: This is used when the dependent variable has three or more possible categories that are not ordered. For example, classifying animals into categories like \"cat,\" \"dog\" or \"sheep.\" It extends the binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `Ordinal Logistic Regression`: This type applies when the dependent variable has three or more categories with a natural order or ranking. Examples include ratings like \"low,\" \"medium\" and \"high.\" It takes the order of the categories into account when modeling."
