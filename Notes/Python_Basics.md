python operators

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator,	Name,	Example	
+,	Addition	,x + y	
-,	Subtraction	,x - y	
*,	Multiplication	,x * y	
/,	Division,	x / y	
%	,Modulus	,x % y	
**,	Exponentiation,	x ** y	
//	,Floor division	,x // y

---------------------

Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator,	Example	,Same As	
=,	x = 5	,x = 5	
+=	,x += 3,	x = x + 3	
-=	,x -= 3,	x = x - 3	
*=	,x *= 3,	x = x * 3	
/=	,x /= 3,	x = x / 3	
%=	,x %= 3	,x = x % 3	
//=	,x //= 3,	x = x // 3	
**=	,x **= 3,	x = x ** 3	
&=	,x &= 3,	x = x & 3	
|=	,x |= 3	,x = x | 3	
^=	,x ^= 3,	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	,x >>= 3	,x = x >> 3	
<<=	,x <<= 3,	x = x << 3	
:=	,print(x := 3),	x = 3

The Walrus Operator
Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the "walrus operator". It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
count = len(numbers)  // normal way
if count > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")   

if (count := len(numbers)) > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")  // using walrus operator

The walrus operator allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expressionâ€”which means you can both assign and evaluate in a single line.

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator,	Name,	Example	
==,	Equal,	x == y	
!=,	Not equal,	x != y	
>,	Greater than,	x > y	
<	Less than,	x < y	
>=,	Greater than or equal to,	x >= y	
<=,	Less than or equal to,	x <= y

----------------------------------------

Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator,	Description,	Example	
and ,	Returns True if both statements are true,	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	,Returns True if one of the statements is true,	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	,Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true,	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

------------------------------------------

Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

Operator,	Description	Example	
is, 	Returns True if both variables are the same object,	x is y	
is not,	Returns True if both variables are not the same object,	x is not y

--------------------------------------------

Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

Operator,	Description	Example
in, 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object,	x in y	
not in,	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object,	x not in y

------------------------------------------------

Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

Operator,	Name,	Description	Example	
& ,	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1,	x & y	
|,	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1,	x | y	
^,	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is, 1	x ^ y	
~,	NOT	Inverts all the bits,	~x	
<<,	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off,	x << 2	
>>,	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off,	x >> 2
