# Data Science

Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines that uses statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and extract knowledge and insights from it.

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is about data gathering, analysis, and decision-making.

It involves finding patterns in data through analysis to make future predictions.

By using Data Science, companies are able to make:

- **Better decisions** (e.g., should we choose A or B?)
- **Predictive analysis** (e.g., what will happen next?)
- **Pattern discoveries** (e.g., find patterns or hidden information in the data)

## How Does a Data Scientist Work?

A Data Scientist requires expertise in several areas:

- Machine Learning  
- Statistics  
- Programming (Python or R)  
- Mathematics  
- Databases  

Before finding patterns, a Data Scientist must organize the data in a standard format.

### Workflow of a Data Scientist

1. **Ask the right questions** – Understand the business problem.
2. **Explore and collect data** – From databases, web logs, customer feedback, etc.
3. **Extract the data** – Transform the data to a standardized format.
4. **Clean the data** – Remove erroneous values.
5. **Find and replace missing values** – Replace missing values with suitable ones (e.g., average).
6. **Normalize data** – Scale values to a practical range  
   _Example: 140 cm is smaller than 1.8 m, but numerically 140 > 1.8, so scaling is important._
7. **Analyze data** – Find patterns and make future predictions.
8. **Represent the result** – Present insights in a way the company can understand.

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of information.

One purpose of Data Science is to structure data, making it interpretable and easy to work with.

### Categories of Data

Data can be categorized into two groups:

- **Structured Data**  
  Organized and formatted data that fits into tables or databases (e.g., spreadsheets, SQL databases).

- **Unstructured Data**  
  Raw and unorganized data that doesn't follow a predefined format (e.g., text documents, images, videos).

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is not organized. We must organize the data for analysis purposes.

### Structured Data
Structured data is organized and easier to work with.

## How to Structure Data?
We can use an array or a database table to structure or present data.

Example of an array:

[80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125]

The following example shows how to create an array in Python:

## Python
Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists.

Python has in-built mathematical libraries and functions, making it easier to calculate mathematical problems and to perform data analysis.

We will provide practical examples using Python.

### Python Libraries
Python has libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools.

In this tutorial, we will use the following libraries:

- [Pandas](EDA/pandas.ipynb) - This library is used for structured data operations, like import CSV files, create dataframes, and data preparation

- [Numpy]() - This is a mathematical library. Has a powerful N-dimensional array object, linear algebra, Fourier transform, etc.

- [Matplotlib]() - This library is used for visualization of data.

- [SciPy]() - This library has linear algebra modules
