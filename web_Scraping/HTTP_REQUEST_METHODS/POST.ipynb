    "# Advantages of using POST Method\n",
    "- It is more secure than GET because user-entered information is never visible in the URL query string or in the server logs.\n",
    "- There is a much larger limit on the amount of data that can be passed and one can send text data as well as binary data (uploading a file) using POST. \n",
    "# Disadvantages of using the POST Method\n",
    "- Since the data sent by the POST method is not visible in the URL, so it is not possible to bookmark the page with specific query.\n",
    "- POST requests are never cached\n",
    "- POST requests do not remain in the browser history."
